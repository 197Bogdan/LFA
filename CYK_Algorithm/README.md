#### CYK is an algorithm that verifies if a given word is part of the language generated by a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) in O(n^3) complexity.

### How to use:
#### In main.py, create a CFGrammar object using
```
cfg = CFGrammar(productions)
```
#### where productions is a list of strings using this format:
```
productions = ["S -> BA | DC | SS | CA | AC",
               "A -> b",
               "B -> CS",
               "C -> a",
               "D -> AS"]
```
#### The format also accepts spaces in productions: "S -> A B" is fine.
#### But try to keep terminal names 1 letter/symbol long as productions are stored as strings and might overlap (having terminals "AB" and "BA" will probably give wrong results because they overlap, having "H1", "H2" would be fine)
#### Make sure the productions respect the Chomsky Normal Form (unknown behaviour otherwise)
#### To convert a given context free grammar to CNF, you can use any online tool (for example: https://cyberzhg.github.io/toolbox/cfg2cnf )

#### Then, use the CYK method of the created cfg object. It returns true if the word passed as argument is accepted, false otherwise.
```
if cfg.CYK("abbba"):
    print("Accepted")
else:
    print("Denied")
```
